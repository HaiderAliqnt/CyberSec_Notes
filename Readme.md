# CTF Prep & Cybersecurity Learning

My personal repository documenting my journey learning penetration testing and preparing for CTF competitions. This repo contains cheat sheets, writeups, custom tools, and notes as I progress through structured security training.

## 📚 What's Inside

### Cheat Sheets
Comprehensive reference guides for tools and techniques:
- **[Nmap Cheat Sheet](cheat-sheets/Nmap_cheatsheet.md)** - Network reconnaissance and port scanning

### Writeups
Documentation of challenges solved and lessons learned:
- Coming soon: TryHackMe rooms, CTF challenges, VulnHub machines

### Tools
Custom security tools built during learning:
- Coming soon: Port scanner, crypto toolkit, automation scripts

## 🎯 Learning Path

Following a structured 3-month roadmap covering:
- **Month 1:** Reconnaissance, web fundamentals, cryptography, Linux mastery
- **Month 2:** Web exploitation, forensics, reverse engineering, privilege escalation
- **Month 3:** CTF practice, weak spot drilling, competition preparation

**Current Status:** Week 1 Complete - Nmap & Network Reconnaissance ✅

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, C++, Bash  
**Security Tools:** Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Wireshark, Gobuster  
**Platforms:** Kali Linux, TryHackMe, picoCTF, HackTheBox  
**Environment:** VirtualBox home lab with intentionally vulnerable targets

## 🏠 Home Lab

- **Attack Machine:** Kali Linux
- **Practice Targets:** Metasploitable2, DVWA
- **Network:** Isolated VirtualBox NAT environment
